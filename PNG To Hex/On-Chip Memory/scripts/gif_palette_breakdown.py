# This script is an adaptation of png_to_palette_relative_resizer.py
# found in Rishi's ECE385-HelperTools. The purpose of this script is to 
# allow you to generate step sized increments to your image to give the
# appearance that the object is coming towards you on screen. In general,
# it allows you to present a 3D feel to your game. This script
# works great for gifs such as the one we used.

#
# You can break the gif you want to use through an online gif decomposer.
# This will give you a bunch of image files that you can then change to 
# a .png format. With those images, a starting size and an ending size 
# in mind, you should be ready to roll.
